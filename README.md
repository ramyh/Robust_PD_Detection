# Robust_PD_Detection

RR stands for Robust Regression
Here, we have three Matlab codes:-
(1) RR_NoisyPD_PosSNR: Applies Robust Regression to the spectrum of the noisy PD signals of Positive SNRs.
(2) RR_NoisyPD_0SNR: Applies Robust Regression to the spectrum of the noisy PD signals of 0dB SNR.
(3) RR_NoisyPD_NegSNR: Applies Robust Regression to the spectrum of the noisy PD signals of Negative SNRs.

The Matlab matrices named "SpectrumNPD_AWGN_Pos_20", "SpectrumNPD_AWGN_Pos_10", "SpectrumNPD_AWGN_0", "SpectrumNPD_AWGN_Neg_10". ...., and "SpectrumNPD_AWGN_Neg_40" include the frequency spectrum of the noisy PD signals corrupted with Additive White Gaussian Noise of the SNRs: 20dB, 10dB, 0dB, -10dB, ....., and -40dB, respectively.

The CSV files named"SpectrumNPD_AWGN_Pos_20_Sparse", "SpectrumNPD_AWGN_Pos_10_Sparse", "SpectrumNPD_AWGN_0_Sparse", "SpectrumNPD_AWGN_Neg_10_Sparse". ...., and "SpectrumNPD_AWGN_Neg_40_Sparse" include the EXTRACTED SPECTRAL FEATURES of the noisy PD signals of the
