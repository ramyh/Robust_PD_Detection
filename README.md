# Robust_PD_Detection
This repository demonstrates how to accurately recognize the different types of acoustic PD signals in noisy environments. The results are very interesting; the proposed method achieves classification accuracies in the range 99.33%-100.00% for noise-corrupted data of SNR -40:30dB.
